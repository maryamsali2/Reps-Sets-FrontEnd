### ***Description***
#### Reps & Sets is a full-stack fitness tracking application designed to help users stay organized and consistent with their workouts. Instead of relying on notebooks or scattered notes, the app provides a structured way to create workout plans, add exercises with sets, reps, and weights, and update them as routines change. With secure authentication, each user has their own personalized space to track progress. The clean and responsive interface makes it simple for both beginners and experienced lifters to manage their fitness journey. This app is useful because it keeps all workout data in one place, making it easier to stay motivated, monitor improvements, and build long-term habits.

### ***Getting Started***

##### After signing in — or registering if you don’t already have an account — you can immediately begin creating workouts. Each workout can include multiple exercises, with details such as sets, reps, and weights. Once saved, your workouts are securely stored under your account, and you have full control to update or delete exercises whenever your training routine changes. This flow makes it simple to manage your fitness progress in one place while keeping everything organized and easy to adjust over time.
